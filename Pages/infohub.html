        1. What does NASA stand for?<br>
        The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is known as NASA. On October 1, 1958, NASA was established as
        a branch of the US government. The United States' space and aviation-related research and technology are under
        the control of NASA.

    </div>
    <div class="even" data-aos="zoom-in-up">2. What is eclipse?<br>
        "Eclipse" refers to the partial or complete blockage of one astronomical object's light by another. When the
        Earth, Moon, and Sun are lined up, an eclipse of the Sun or Moon takes place. The Greek word "ἔκλειψις, ekleípō"
        that gives us the term "eclipse" means "abandonment." The Greeks thought of a solar eclipse as the Sun leaving
        Earth.
    </div>
    <div class="odd" data-aos="zoom-in-down">3. Why do some people on Earth see an eclipse at a given time?<br>
        Every solar eclipse is not experienced by everyone. A chance to witness a total solar eclipse is quite uncommon.
        Only certain locations on Earth will see the Moon's shadow because it isn't very large. When it occurs, you have
        to be on the side of the planet that faces the sun.
    </div>
    <div class="even" data-aos="zoom-in-left">
        4. What causes Sun Moon and Earth to align?<br>
        The orbital movements of the Sun, Moon, and Earth as well as the gravitational forces between them are what
        essentially determine the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth.

    </div>
    <div class="odd" data-aos="zoom-in-right">5. How often do eclipses occur?<br>
        Eclipses are generally common, although how frequently they happen depends on the sort of eclipse and where you
        are on Earth.<br>
        • Total Solar Eclipses: Approximately once every 18 months worldwide, but specific locations experience them
        less often.<br>

        • Partial Solar Eclipses: A few times a year from various places on Earth.<br>
        • Total Lunar Eclipses: About 2 to 4 times annually, visible from different parts of the world.<br>
        • Partial Lunar Eclipses: More frequent, occurring several times each year.</div>
    <div class="even" data-aos="zoom-out">
        6. How do scientists know when and where an eclipse will occur?<br>
        Mathematical simulations, accurate information on the locations of celestial objects, and cycles like the Saros
        and Metonic cycles are all used by scientists to forecast eclipses. Computer simulations improve forecasts,
        making it possible to precisely determine the dates and places of eclipses. These predictions are strengthened
        by further observations.

    </div>
    <div class="odd" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-offset="300" data-aos-easing="ease-in-sine">7. What is the
        difference between lunar and solar eclipse?<br>
        Solar Eclipse:<br>
        • Happens during the day when the Moon covers the Sun.<br>
        • You see a dark circle in the sky.<br>
        • Can be total (Sun completely hidden) or partial (part of the Sun hidden).<br>
        • Rare and only visible in certain places.<br>
        Lunar Eclipse:<br>
        • Happens at night when the Earth's shadow covers the Moon.<br>
        • The Moon can turn red or dark.<br>
        • Can be seen from wherever it's nighttime.<br>
        • More common than solar eclipses.<br>
        So, solar eclipses are like the Sun disappearing during the day, and lunar eclipses are like the Moon changing
        color at night
    </div>
    <div class="even" data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-anchor="#example-anchor" data-aos-offset="500"
        data-aos-duration="500">8. What is an eclipse season?<br>
        An eclipse season is a roughly 34.5-day period, occurring twice a year. During this time, the Moon, Earth, and
        Sun line up in a way that makes it possible for eclipses to occur. Eclipses aren't guaranteed during these
        periods, but they're more likely to happen. It's like having a better chance of seeing a specific event during
        these specific times of the year.
    </div>
    <div class="odd" data-aos="flip-left" data-aos-easing="ease-out-cubic" data-aos-duration="2000">9. What is a Red
        Moon(Blood Moon)?<br>
        A Red Moon, also known as a "Blood Moon," is the result of a total lunar eclipse. During this event, Earth's
        atmosphere scatters shorter-wavelength light, allowing longer-wavelength red and orange light to reach and color
        the Moon, giving it a reddish appearance. It's a stunning celestial phenomenon.
    </div>
    <div class="even" data-aos="flip-left">10. What are the types of Solar eclipses?<br>
        • Total Solar Eclipse: The Moon completely covers the Sun, creating a temporary darkening of the day. Only
        visible from a specific area on Earth.<br>
        • Partial Solar Eclipse: Only a portion of the Sun is covered by the Moon. People in certain regions see a
        "bite" taken out of the Sun.<br>
        • Annular Solar Eclipse: The Moon is slightly farther from Earth, making it appear smaller and leaving a
        ring-like shape (the "Ring of Fire") around the Sun.<br>
        • Hybrid Solar Eclipse: A rare type that transitions between annular and total phases along its path, starting
        as one type and becoming another.<br>


    </div>
    <div class="odd" data-aos="flip-right">11. What are the types of lunar eclipses?<br>
        • Total Lunar Eclipse: Earth's shadow completely covers the Moon, causing it to appear red or coppery.<br>
        • Partial Lunar Eclipse: Only a portion of the Moon enters Earth's shadow, leading to partial darkening.<br>
        • Penumbral Lunar Eclipse: The Moon passes through Earth's outer shadow (penumbra), resulting in subtle shading
        on the Moon's surface, often less noticeable.<br>
    </div>

    <div class="even" data-aos="flip-up">12. What is a partial eclipse?<br>
        A partial solar eclipse occurs when the Moon covers only a portion of the Sun, creating a "bite" out of the
        Sun's disk. This happens when the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth is such that the Moon only partially
        blocks the Sun's light from certain locations on Earth. It's essential to use proper eye protection when
        observing a partial solar eclipse, as looking at the Sun without protection can cause eye damage.<br>
        A partial lunar eclipse happens when part of the Moon enters Earth's shadow, causing only a portion of the Moon
        to darken. It's a visually striking event and safe to observe.
    </div>
    <div class="odd" data-aos="flip-down">13. What is a total eclipse?<br>
        A total solar eclipse is when the Moon completely covers the Sun, briefly turning day into night in a narrow
        area on Earth. It's a rare and stunning celestial event that requires proper eye protection to observe safely.
        A total lunar eclipse happens when the Earth's shadow completely covers the Moon, making it appear red or
        coppery often referred to as a "Blood Moon.". It's a striking and safe celestial event visible from a broad
        area.
    </div>
    <div class="even" data-aos="zoom-in">14. What is umbra?<br>
        The "umbra" is the darkest part of a shadow, where light is completely blocked. In astronomy, it's the central
        and darkest part of a celestial body's shadow during an eclipse. The term "umbra" comes from the Latin word for
        "shadow."
    </div>
    <div class="odd" data-aos="zoom-in-up">15. What is penumbra?<br>
        The "penumbra" is the lighter, outer part of a shadow where some light is blocked but not all. In astronomy,
        it's the outer region of a celestial body's shadow during an eclipse, allowing some light to pass through. The
        term "penumbra" comes from the Latin words for "almost" and "shadow."


    </div>
    <div class="even" data-aos="zoom-in-down">16. What is an annular solar eclipse?<br>
        An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon is at a point in its orbit where it appears slightly smaller than
        the Sun. During this eclipse, the Moon covers the center of the Sun, leaving a ring-like appearance (the "Ring
        of Fire") of the Sun's outer edge visible. It's a striking celestial event.
    </div>
    <div class="odd" data-aos="zoom-in-left">17. What is a hybrid solar eclipse?<br>
        A hybrid solar eclipse is a rare eclipse that starts as an annular eclipse (Ring of Fire) and transitions into a
        total eclipse as it moves along its path. The type you see depends on your location.
    </div>
    <div class="even" data-aos="zoom-in-left">18. What is a penumbral lunar eclipse?<br>
        A penumbral lunar eclipse is a lunar eclipse with a subtle shading of the Moon's surface, caused by the Moon
        passing through Earth's outer shadow (penumbra). Penumbral lunar eclipses can be more challenging to observe
        because the dimming effect is mild.
    </div>
    <div class="odd" data-aos="zoom-in-left">19. What is the Saros cycle of eclipses?<br>
        The Saros cycle is an 18-year, 11-day cycle of eclipses, both lunar and solar, with similar characteristics.
        Eclipses within the same Saros cycle share type and features but shift in location. It's crucial for eclipse
        prediction.
    </div>
    <div class="even" data-aos="zoom-out-up">20. What is the diamond ring effect?<br>
        The "Diamond Ring Effect" is a bright, diamond-like flash of light seen just before or after a total solar
        eclipse when the Sun's light passes through valleys on the Moon's surface. It's a captivating moment during
        eclipse observations.
